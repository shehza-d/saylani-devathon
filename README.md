### Task Description

You are tasked with developing a "Find Doctor" application with specific features. This application is aimed at helping patients find the best doctors within a healthcare organization, book appointments, and connect with medical professionals. Additionally, there should be an admin web application (in case, if you have time available) for managing doctor availability and making necessary modifications. The application should be user-friendly and accessible. Below are the feature requirements:

### Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   Implement social login options through Facebook and Google.
   Include the ability for users to sign in using their email and password.

1. **Doctor Search:**
   Users should be able to search for the best doctors within a healthcare organization.
   Doctors should be listed based on reviews and experience, with detailed profiles for each.

The code should be well-organized and documented for clarity.
Provide a user manual or instructions on how to use the application.
Include a brief report outlining the technologies and frameworks used, any challenges faced, and potential improvements for future development.

### Evaluation Criteria

Adherence to the specified features and requirements.
User interface design and user experience.
Code quality, organization, and documentation.
Successful implementation of social login and appointment booking.
Responsiveness and performance of the mobile app.
Functionality and usability of the admin web application.
Effective use of filters for doctor search.
